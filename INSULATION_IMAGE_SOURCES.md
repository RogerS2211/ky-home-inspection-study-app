1. **Hardware Store Photos** (get permission first):
   - Photograph insulation product displays
   - Take close-ups of packaging showing products
   - Focus on: Fiberglass batts, XPS/EPS boards, mineral wool

2. **Job Site Photos** (with permission):
   - Document various insulation installations
   - Capture close-ups showing texture and color
   - Photograph both installed and product forms

## Notes

- The existing deck "Structure Types" uses images located in `public/images/structures/` as a reference
- All image paths in the deck are formatted as: `/images/insulation/[filename].jpg`
- The Card component (src/components/Card.tsx) already handles image display properly
- Images display above the question text with max-height of 300px

Good luck with your image sourcing! The combination of InspectAPedia educational photos, manufacturer product images, and government resources should provide everything you need.
